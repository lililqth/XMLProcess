It is a tool to merge different charts in stateflow.  
1. /stateflow_API/mergeChart.m uses stateflow api to move all of the states and data in different charts to the first chart  
2. xmlProcess.py will delete all the superfluous lines and charts, and set the decomposition of the first chart to be 'AND'.
